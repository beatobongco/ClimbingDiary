# Climbing Diary

## 2016/8/10

* Wrote a training plan inspired by Self-Coached Climber https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skw9ZMdi4HQ_D2pGxkm9_5aw6sZmBhUmpOfsPcaBnDM/edit

* Plan synergizes with PeakList http://beatobongco.com/PeakList/

* Routes to work on tomorrow: Beer, a hard, crimpy 6b+ and Red Cat, 6b+ (formerly 6c) with a crimp match crux. If time permits and finger also, work on Drogo, a hard slab 6c with a crimpy crux.

* Routes to review: Brownie, 6b+ steep pocket route. Music Time Machine, a 6b overhanging juggy route. RGP, 6b+ footwork route. 50 shades, 6b with weird crimpy holds. And extra vertical/slab 6b+ routes.

* Great Saturday training session yesterday! Finished 2 new 6b+'s: Big Bird Jops and Red Cat.
* Note to self: work on Beer, John Snow, Big Bird Jops , Red Cat.
* Pretty solid already with Brownie and Music Time Machine. Can repeat for practice but not a priority.
* I wanna work on Maldives (6c+) and the lime green 6c+ on Music Time Machine's line.

## 2016/8/15
* Did sprinting intervals today! Hopefully rest is adequate for a super strong bouldering day tomorrow (for which I am psyched!)
* Will do fall training with Denise tomorrow
* Plan to do 4x4's tomorrow but will first refine movement on Magenta, Yellow Tap, White Commit and Roof Start (ascending order)
* If we were to assign numbers then they would be weighted from 1-4
* Thought of making a function that returns the partition with the most unique numbers > 0, useful for ramping up difficulty.
