# Climbing Diary

## 2016/8/10

* Wrote a training plan inspired by Self-Coached Climber https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skw9ZMdi4HQ_D2pGxkm9_5aw6sZmBhUmpOfsPcaBnDM/edit

* Plan synergizes with PeakList http://beatobongco.com/PeakList/

* Routes to work on tomorrow: Beer, a hard, crimpy 6b+ and Red Cat, 6b+ (formerly 6c) with a crimp match crux. If time permits and finger also, work on Drogo, a hard slab 6c with a crimpy crux.

* Routes to review: Brownie, 6b+ steep pocket route. Music Time Machine, a 6b overhanging juggy route. RGP, 6b+ footwork route. 50 shades, 6b with weird crimpy holds. And extra vertical/slab 6b+ routes.
