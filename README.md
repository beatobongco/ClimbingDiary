# Climbing Diary

## 2016/8/10

* Wrote a training plan inspired by Self-Coached Climber https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skw9ZMdi4HQ_D2pGxkm9_5aw6sZmBhUmpOfsPcaBnDM/edit

* Plan synergizes with PeakList http://beatobongco.com/PeakList/

* Routes to work on tomorrow: Beer, a hard, crimpy 6b+ and Red Cat, 6b+ (formerly 6c) with a crimp match crux. If time permits and finger also, work on Drogo, a hard slab 6c with a crimpy crux.

* Routes to review: Brownie, 6b+ steep pocket route. Music Time Machine, a 6b overhanging juggy route. RGP, 6b+ footwork route. 50 shades, 6b with weird crimpy holds. And extra vertical/slab 6b+ routes.

## 2016/8/14

* Great Saturday training session yesterday! Finished 2 new 6b+'s: Big Bird Jops and Red Cat.
* Note to self: work on Beer, John Snow, Big Bird Jops , Red Cat.
* Pretty solid already with Brownie and Music Time Machine. Can repeat for practice but not a priority.
* I wanna work on Maldives (6c+) and the lime green 6c+ on Music Time Machine's line.

## 2016/8/15
* Did sprinting intervals today! Hopefully rest is adequate for a super strong bouldering day tomorrow (for which I am psyched!)
* Will do fall training with Denise tomorrow
* Plan to do 4x4's tomorrow but will first refine movement on Magenta, Yellow Tap, White Commit and Roof Start (ascending order)
* If we were to assign numbers then they would be weighted from 1-4
* Thought of making a function that returns the partition with the most unique numbers > 0, useful for ramping up difficulty.

## 2016/8/16
 * Thought of an easy way to ramp up difficulty using a bit of math.
 * Idea is to have more variety in climbs, while climbing near your moderate intensity limit (for Power Endurance), without repeating a boulder per rep. 
 * Rank 4 hardest onsight boulders in ascending order of difficulty and then choose a level.
``` 
4x4 level chart
Get your 4 hardest boulders and rank them 1 - 4

 1 [1, 0, 0, 0] 
 2 [2, 0, 0, 0] 
 3 [2, 1, 0, 0] 
 4 [3, 1, 0, 0] 
 5 [3, 2, 0, 0] 
 6 [3, 2, 1, 0] 
 7 [4, 2, 1, 0] 
 8 [4, 3, 1, 0] 
 9 [4, 3, 2, 0] 
10 [4, 3, 2, 1] 
```
 * This is mainly used for calibrating.
 * Pick a level that causes you to redline near the end (falling off is OK) and then stick with it until you can consistently feel good on all 4 sets.
 * Once it starts to become trivial, level up. 
 * Once you reach level 10, upgrade your list of 4 hardest onsight boulders.
 * I will start later at Level 3, and Denise will start at Level 1.

## 2016/8/17
 * So today I started at Level 1 for the 4x4's. I decided to take it slow and also, yellow felt a little heavy. But I can definitely level up to 3 next session! Confident about it.
 * Denise did well at Level 0 [0, 0, 0, 0]. It was too easy so we'll be taking that to Level 1 next session.
 * Finished a long time enemy, Columbia 6b+ on the autobelay. Super satisfying. Will add that to my list, but unique.
 * List for Thursday: 
  * Autobelay: Black Sloper, Columbia
  * New routes: Maldives (6c+), and hard lime green (6c+)
  * Toprope: Beer, John Snow, Big Bird Jops, Red Cat, RGP
  * Huge TODO: For warmup drills tomorrow focus on elegant switch of feet :D 20 minutes of dat shit!

## 2016/8/18
 * Great session today. Tried switch feet warmup drills. I'm not so good at them yet but that's why I'm doing them right?
 * While warming up, Eman showed me the "front step" (most likely wrong name for it) where you flag you have one foot stepping on a hold,and the other goes in front of that foot and flags on the wall. So if right foot on hold, left foot crosses over in front of right leg and flags. This is used to reach left without switching feet. More efficient if you ask me.
 * Worked on Mkchief Maker (steep pocket/pinch arete 6c+). Stoked to have connected all the moves, which I did not expect to do. Thought it would take 2 weeks. Was able to use the "front step" technique in the crux!
 * Route goes like this: Two pockets to three cheese edges, two slopey pinches you go up real quick, then a good left sidepull, followed by an OK right crimp. First crux is getting left hand on the left crimp because we barn door. That's where front step comes in, or at least flagging side on the right wall. Then we got a moderate section of 3 sloper pills. Second crux is getting the top of the 3 pills with right hand, crossing over left to pinch and then a push to get the last jug with left. Sorta long move but doesn't require a dyno. Perhaps deadpoint.
 * Next steps: Work the first crux. When that's clean, work the bottom to be efficient. Top should be OK as long as I have energy.
 * Should focus on doing Drago (crimpy slab 6c) and Black Chips (??? 6c) next. Totally forgot there were some legit 6c's I could project.
 * Was able to finish all but Jon Snow on my TODO list! Did Beer on first attempt. RGP is getting way smooth. Red Cat feels good too, but not a clean ascent today. Big Bird Jops is not very efficient, not clean ascent to day too. To order in terms of work:
 * `Beer`, `Big Bird Jops`, `Red Cat`, `John Snow`, `RGP`
 * Denise connected Brownie (6b+) with super cool non-dyno beta for the top. She can totally finish it next week!
