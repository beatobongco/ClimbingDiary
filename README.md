# Climbing Diary

## 2016/8/10

* Wrote a training plan inspired by Self-Coached Climber https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skw9ZMdi4HQ_D2pGxkm9_5aw6sZmBhUmpOfsPcaBnDM/edit

* Plan synergizes with PeakList http://beatobongco.com/PeakList/

* Routes to work on tomorrow: Beer, a hard, crimpy 6b+ and Red Cat, 6b+ (formerly 6c) with a crimp match crux.
