# Climbing Diary

## 2016/8/10

* Wrote a training plan inspired by Self-Coached Climber https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skw9ZMdi4HQ_D2pGxkm9_5aw6sZmBhUmpOfsPcaBnDM/edit

* Plan synergizes with PeakList http://beatobongco.com/PeakList/

* Routes to work on tomorrow: Beer, a hard, crimpy 6b+ and Red Cat, 6b+ (formerly 6c) with a crimp match crux. If time permits and finger also, work on Drogo, a hard slab 6c with a crimpy crux.

* Routes to review: Brownie, 6b+ steep pocket route. Music Time Machine, a 6b overhanging juggy route. RGP, 6b+ footwork route. 50 shades, 6b with weird crimpy holds. And extra vertical/slab 6b+ routes.

## 2016/8/14

* Great Saturday training session yesterday! Finished 2 new 6b+'s: Big Bird Jops and Red Cat.
* Note to self: work on Beer, John Snow, Big Bird Jops , Red Cat.
* Pretty solid already with Brownie and Music Time Machine. Can repeat for practice but not a priority.
* I wanna work on Maldives (6c+) and the lime green 6c+ on Music Time Machine's line.

## 2016/8/15
* Did sprinting intervals today! Hopefully rest is adequate for a super strong bouldering day tomorrow (for which I am psyched!)
* Will do fall training with Denise tomorrow
* Plan to do 4x4's tomorrow but will first refine movement on Magenta, Yellow Tap, White Commit and Roof Start (ascending order)
* If we were to assign numbers then they would be weighted from 1-4
* Thought of making a function that returns the partition with the most unique numbers > 0, useful for ramping up difficulty.

## 2016/8/16
 * Thought of an easy way to ramp up difficulty using a bit of math.
 * Idea is to have more variety in climbs, while climbing near your moderate intensity limit (for Power Endurance), without repeating a boulder per rep. 
 * Rank 4 hardest onsight boulders in ascending order of difficulty and then choose a level.
``` 
4x4 level chart
Get your 4 hardest boulders and rank them 1 - 4

 1 [1, 0, 0, 0] 
 2 [2, 0, 0, 0] 
 3 [2, 1, 0, 0] 
 4 [3, 1, 0, 0] 
 5 [3, 2, 0, 0] 
 6 [3, 2, 1, 0] 
 7 [4, 2, 1, 0] 
 8 [4, 3, 1, 0] 
 9 [4, 3, 2, 0] 
10 [4, 3, 2, 1] 
```
 * This is mainly used for calibrating.
 * Pick a level that causes you to redline near the end (falling off is OK) and then stick with it until you can consistently feel good on all 4 sets.
 * Once it starts to become trivial, level up. 
 * Once you reach level 10, upgrade your list of 4 hardest onsight boulders.
 * I will start later at Level 3, and Denise will start at Level 1.

## 2016/8/17
 * So today I started at Level 1 for the 4x4's. I decided to take it slow and also, yellow felt a little heavy. But I can definitely level up to 3 next session! Confident about it.
 * Denise did well at Level 0 [0, 0, 0, 0]. It was too easy so we'll be taking that to Level 1 next session.
 * Finished a long time enemy, Columbia 6b+ on the autobelay. Super satisfying. Will add that to my list, but unique.
 * List for Thursday: 
  * Autobelay: Black Sloper, Columbia
  * New routes: Maldives (6c+), and hard lime green (6c+)
  * Toprope: Beer, John Snow, Big Bird Jops, Red Cat, RGP
  * Huge TODO: For warmup drills tomorrow focus on elegant switch of feet :D 20 minutes of dat shit!

## 2016/8/18
 * Great session today. Tried switch feet warmup drills. I'm not so good at them yet but that's why I'm doing them right?
 * While warming up, Eman showed me the "front step" (most likely wrong name for it) where you flag you have one foot stepping on a hold,and the other goes in front of that foot and flags on the wall. So if right foot on hold, left foot crosses over in front of right leg and flags. This is used to reach left without switching feet. More efficient if you ask me.
 * Worked on Mkchief Maker (steep pocket/pinch arete 6c+). Stoked to have connected all the moves, which I did not expect to do. Thought it would take 2 weeks. Was able to use the "front step" technique in the crux!
 * Route goes like this: Two pocket right cross to a match on a cheese edge, go to next cheese edge and left to third small cheese edge. Match on a subpar rail while balancing on a cheesem then two slopey pinches you go up real quick, then a good left sidepull, followed by an OK right crimp. First crux is getting left hand on the left crimp because we barn door. That's where front step comes in, or at least flagging side on the right wall. Then we got a moderate section of 3 sloper pills. Second crux is getting the top of the 3 pills with right hand, crossing over left to pinch and then a push to get the last jug with left. Sorta long move but doesn't require a dyno. Perhaps deadpoint.
 * Next steps: Work the first crux. When that's clean, work the bottom to be efficient. Top should be OK as long as I have energy.
 * Should focus on doing Drago (crimpy slab 6c) and Black Chips (??? 6c) next. Totally forgot there were some legit 6c's I could project. If I finish these two, I raise my pyramid base to 6c! :D Then the real work has to be put in.
 * Was able to finish all but Jon Snow on my TODO list! Did Beer on first attempt. RGP is getting way smooth. Red Cat feels good too, but not a clean ascent today. Big Bird Jops is not very efficient, not clean ascent to day too. To order in terms of work:
 * `Beer`, `Big Bird Jops`, `Red Cat`, `John Snow`, `RGP`
 * Denise connected Brownie (6b+) with super cool non-dyno beta for the top. She can totally finish it next week!

## 2016/8/20
 * Repeated Black Sloper (1st try, easy) and Columbia (2nd try, moderately hard) while warming up.
 * Spent whole session today working on Mkchief Maker (6c+). Hardest route I've ever worked efficiently. After whole day, last two tries were good ascents except for failing to latch final jug. I need to commit more!
 * Beta goes like this: Cross start on two pockets, right to next pocket, high step left and then reach for first cheese, right foot into wall and twist in, reach right for next cheese. Bump to small cheese. Left hard crimp to poop rail. Smear right foot while quickly lifting left foot to first cheese. Good rest here. Quick left, right to slopers. Right foot to next cheese, get left to good left crimp. Right to small crimp. Lift right to top of rail. Quickly back step and commit left to second small crimp. Really quickly: left smear, bite down on left fingers, right foot to sloper, twist in and fall into right hand to 1st sloping big pill. Easy sloper ladder: second and third big pill. Good rest on left of arete. Abuse it. Get right hand on 3rd pill, cross with second hand on 2nd pill. Move to right of arete. Step left to first small crimp, twist in hard, hard mantle on right hand while left reaches for jug. There is a mental commit barrier just before latching the jug. Just pass through it! And DONE!
 * Good work on letting go of ego. Was consumed by it on the latter part of the session but finally let go of it towards the end. Ego doesn't help your training, it just gets in the way.

## 2016/8/23
 * Extremely stoked to have sent Mkchief Maker (6c+)! Felt really light today save for the middle crimp crux. Pushed past the mental barrier on the end crux also. This is a sure sign I need to boulder more. It's always great to have these insights.
 * Bouldered today, went up to level 6! That's White Commit, Yellow Tap and Magenta. There may be a flaw in my system. To be less complicated, maybe should just follow template of roped climbing. 1 hour trying new routes and 4x4 doing repeat ascents of hardest climbs.
 * For the next boulder session, I plan to add Black Roof Start. I need to practice the end, matching on that bad crimp. I think I can manage that. That's level 10 next session.
 * For Denise, Will have her send Yellow Tap and then add that to her 4x4.

## 2016/8/27
 * SUPER PSYCHED to have competed in first fun comp! Sent exactly 50 routes!
 * Weaknesses to work on: need to ignore pressure and stick to reading routes correctly and climbing fluidly. Need to take a tad more risk. 
 * Work on the ff routes: Mango (6a+ crackish climb), Tetris (6b+ jib climb).
 * Work on the ff skills: Bouldering (lagging behind route climbing), Clipping (understandably bad, but can be practiced every day.
 * Self pat on the back for awesome endurance of both Denise and I! So many climbs and we still did antagonist + boulders after. I think increase in intensity is needed! Also maybe an extra training day for me like Sunday mornings!

## 2016/8/30
 * Bouldering today. Very pleased that was able to complete 2 new green-taped boulders: Black Roof Start and Green Volume. Added them to my 4x4 but it's not perfect yet. I failed on my last few reps. That just means more refinement is required!
 * Den almost finished Yellow Tap!
 * New bouldering training plan seems to be working! :) Just a bit more discipline needed to stick to time and rest conventions and we should be totally peachy!

## 2016/9/1
 * Route climbing today. Super stoken we've got 3 lines re-set with routes! Finished Sisid (6b), Bakit Pocket (6b) and Jump Start (6c). Very happy that Sisid was a flash and Jump Start was an easy 3 try. 
 * Pockets are my weakness though and Bakit Pocket was only sent after some analysis and around 5 attempts. At least I know what to work on!
 * Tried 9 Lives (7a), a route I worked on a month back but gave up on. It was totally doable even in fatigued state! Fell on the last hold though. This training is really working.
 * 9 Lives is a slopey, dynamic route that Joey said might not be a 7a. So I'll think of it 6c+ grade to be safe. I should be able to send it this saturday and I better since it will be gone next Tuesday.
 * Worked on Beer (6b+). Still the hardest 6b+ ever. Working into the habit of sticking the crux consistently. Gave it around 4 tries for a redpoint. Happy I could send it but want to be able to do it in 2 tries max.
 * Den did well! Sisid is quite reachy for her, so she has to do around 2-3 dynos for reachy parts. It's really good for her tho. She is learning fast!

## 2016/9/3
 * Mix of bouldering and route climbing today.
 * Tried to tackle 9 lives (7a). Very surprised to have dialed all the moves save for the single move to the final hold. A very slopey route, it helped me learn how to trust my contact strength. Last move is a big move to an OK edge. There are 2 ways I know to approach: match on the second to the last hold (pinch/sloper), cut feet to smear and place right foot on a good edge, twist in hard and deadpoint. I've stuck that move around 3 times only. The other way is a direct deadpoint without getting feet higher which seems lighter but can't seem to stick it.
 * Am a little disappointed that I wasn't able to finish it but proud that I was able to walk away from it without having my day destroyed. The send shouldn't matter but the climb as a whole. The climb as a whole was very satisfactory.
 * Den completed Sisid twice! She's really sticking those deadpoint/dynos well now!
 * Really stoked to have completed Jump Start and Bakit Pocket back-to-back. Endurance I would say is top!
 * For bouldering just reviewed all previously sent routes. Really happy I repeated them all without falling. I think I have the lessons dialed down. Next objective is to add something else to my 4x4.
 * Gave some bad tries to Black Chips and Drago, both 6c's. Bad to have attempted them at a very suboptimal state. Black Chips I'm sure I can do fresh. Drago feels a bit impossible because of the foot reachiness, but I reckon its just plain body positioning lacking on that slab, not at all strength.

## 2016/9/4
 * Found a great place to train while I'm visiting Greg http://www.susf.com.au/the-ledge.html I'll try to keep my one day on/off schedule while there. :) 
 * TODO: research on general fitness training I can do while in KP!

## 2016/9/6
 * Bouldering day today. Got to CCM really early because Den had an interview so she'd been there since 1.
 * Reviewed old boulders. Climbed a bit sloppily.
 * Sent Purple Crimper (green tape) quite easily but gave up on Green Slope Start because of a move that compromises my shoulder.
 * Best 4x4 ever: attempted 4 green tapes per set. Den tried 2 green tapes and 2 yellows. I did 3/4 for all of the sets, which means I may have to dial it down a bit. But maybe next session 4/4 green tapes would be totally doable. We shall see.
 * We were totally destroyed after the session. **TIREDEST** I've ever been, even more than the comp probably.
 * I take this to mean my anaerobic endurance and bouldering level is below par. Good thing we're training it.
 * Attempted to send some new routes on the steep walls. Lousy results. Super. Shouldn't even have attempted it. Next time, no mixing bouldering and route days!

## 2016/9/8
 * Route climbing today. Felt extremely tired, couldn't even do Black Sloper (6c+)! I can usually do that route while tired and its usually very very easy for me.
 * It was a challenge today. I attribute this not only to tiredness but to onset of fever. I would predict my strength levels plummeted to 25%. I was almost falling on 5's and fell on a 6a!
 * Was able to climb some 6b's without falling (Sisid Marino and Bakit Pocket) which was very satisfying. Also connected a pockety 6c and a heavy 6b+ (forgot the names). 
 * Discovered something interesting: to make up for my low energy and strength levels, I relied more on my feet and by pushing (mantling?) more on holds. Takeaway is despite fatigue I should still be able to climb. Also, when I'm back to 100% I should focus more on offloading effort to technique. Physical fitness is a slice in time but technique is (almost) forever.
 * Left early today because I could barely grip anything. A lesson in humility and ego is the enemy. At least I got to watch Train to Busan with Den :) 

## 2016/9/10
 * Skipped climbing today to facilitate rest. Fever is such a bitch. Insyncers went climbing in Rizal and I'm stuck here.
 * Will come back 100%!!
