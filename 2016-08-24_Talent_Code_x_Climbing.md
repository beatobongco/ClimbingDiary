# Talent Code x Climbing

A very quick runthrough of concepts and which ones I can connect to climbing.

## Introduction

Introduces terms: `talent hotbed`, `myelin`

## Chapter 2

Introduces: `deep practice`

> *p. 12* Inside talent hotbeds -> `moments of slow, fitful struggle`

To perform deep practice in climbing, one must pick routes in one's "sweet spot": hard enough to pose a challenge,
easy enough to have progress. Perhaps this synergizes with the climbing pyramid, by starting with filling up the base
and then practicing conquered routes again.

> *p. 23* ```The first time we watch Brunio try the move,
he fails, then stops and thinks. He does it again more slowly
and fails again—the ball squirts away. He stops and thinks
again. He does it even more slowly, breaking the move down
to its component parts—this, this, and that.```

Like "reading the route" upon failure. Rehearse the moves before trying again. This and that, this, this, and that.
If you make a mistake during a route, let go to avoid wasting endurance and think about what feels wrong then adjust.

> *p. 28* ```Deep practice is built on a paradox: struggling in certain
targeted ways—operating at the edges of your ability, where
you make mistakes—makes you smarter. Or to put it a slightly
different way, experiences where you're forced to slow down,
make errors, and correct them—as you would if you were
walking up an ice-covered hill, slipping and stumbling as you
go—end up making you swift and graceful without your real-
izing it.```

Deep practice is built upon failure. One should not be afraid of failure. Seek failure.
Tie this to Ego Is The Enemy. Why be afraid if it has objectively good properties, such as accelerated learning?

This is not to say one should join all contests. Say: a comp where routes are 5.12+ and one's climbing limit is 5.11.
There is nothing to be gained in that. I think one should seek out comps where the grades are within his limit ability,
so 5.11 comp would be ideal.

If one objectively assesses his abilities one can arrive at the correct conlusion.

few seconds, is far more useful than several hundred observa-
tions.```
