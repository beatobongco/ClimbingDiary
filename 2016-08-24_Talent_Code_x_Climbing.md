# Talent Code x Climbing

A very quick runthrough of concepts and which ones I can connect to climbing.

## Introduction

Introduces terms: `talent hotbed`, `myelin`

## Chapter 1: The Sweet Spot

Introduces: `deep practice`

> *p. 2* Inside talent hotbeds -> `moments of slow, fitful struggle`

To perform deep practice in climbing, one must pick routes in one's "sweet spot": hard enough to pose a challenge,
easy enough to have progress. Perhaps this synergizes with the climbing pyramid, by starting with filling up the base
and then practicing conquered routes again.

> *p. 13* ```The first time we watch Brunio try the move,
he fails, then stops and thinks. He does it again more slowly
and fails again—the ball squirts away. He stops and thinks
again. He does it even more slowly, breaking the move down
to its component parts—this, this, and that.```

Like "reading the route" upon failure. Rehearse the moves before trying again. This and that, this, this, and that.
If you make a mistake during a route, let go to avoid wasting endurance and think about what feels wrong then adjust.

> *p. 18* ```Deep practice is built on a paradox: struggling in certain
targeted ways—operating at the edges of your ability, where
you make mistakes—makes you smarter. Or to put it a slightly
different way, experiences where you're forced to slow down,
make errors, and correct them—as you would if you were
walking up an ice-covered hill, slipping and stumbling as you
go—end up making you swift and graceful without your real-
izing it.```

Deep practice is built upon failure. One should not be afraid of failure. Seek failure.
Tie this to Ego Is The Enemy. Why be afraid if it has objectively good properties, such as accelerated learning?

This is not to say one should join all contests. Say: a comp where routes are 5.12+ and one's climbing limit is 5.11.
There is nothing to be gained in that. I think one should seek out comps where the grades are within his limit ability,
so 5.11 comp would be ideal.

If one objectively assesses his abilities one can arrive at the correct conlusion.

> *p. 18* ```One real encounter, even for a
few seconds, is far more useful than several hundred observa-
tions.```

> *p. 20* Link Trainer

Learn by doing. Always by doing. E.g. if someone is teaching and you wanna learn, always volunteer for the hands-on part.

> *p. 27* Brazil's secret weapon -> ```One reason lies in the math. Futsal players touch the ball
far more often than soccer players—six times more often per
minute, according to a Liverpool University study. The smaller,
heavier ball demands and rewards more precise handling—as
coaches point out, you can't get out of a tight spot simply by
booting the ball downfield. Sharp passing is paramount: the
game is all about looking for angles and spaces and working
quick combinations with other players. Ball control and vi-
sion are crucial, so that when futsal players play the full-size
game, they feel as if they have acres of free space in which to
operate.```

How to replicate futsal for climbing? More climbing volume. 

More volume -> Volume is rooted in endurance/power endurance.

ARC-M: ARC training + movement drills
4x4SS: Doing bouldering 4x4's at the sweet spot
pre-reading routes to save energy + identify rests

## Chapter 2: The Deep Practice Cell

> *p. 32* ```The more we fire a particular circuit, the more
myelin optimizes that circuit, and the stronger, faster, and
more fluent our movements and thoughts become.```

Mistakes in climbing signify a weak circuit. It needs to be optimized through repetition.
Condition yourself to respond happily when you find low-grade routes you have difficulty in.
They are a myelin treasure chest!

LOW GRADE + FAILURE = REPETITION x HAPPINESS

> *p. 33* ```Skill is myelin insulation that wraps neural circuits and that grows according to certain signals.```

Skill as a muscle.

> *p. 34* ```Q: Why is targeted, mistake-focused practice so effec-
tive?
A: Because the best way to build a good circuit is to fire
it, attend to mistakes, then fire it again, over and over.
Struggle is not an option: it's a biological requirement.
Q: Why are passion and persistence key ingredients of
talent?
A: Because wrapping myelin around a big circuit re-
quires immense energy and time. If you don't love it,
you'll never work hard enough to be great.```

> *p. 52* ```In Genius Explained, Dr. Michael Howe of Exeter
University estimates that Mozart, by his sixth birthday, had
studied 3,500 hours of music with his instructor-father, a fact
that places his musical memory in the realm of impressive but
obtainable skill.```

Geniuses practiced. A lot. Obsessively.
