# Talent Code x Climbing

A very quick runthrough of concepts and which ones I can connect to climbing.

## Introduction

Introduces terms: `talent hotbed`, `myelin`

## Chapter 1: The Sweet Spot

Introduces: `deep practice`

> *p. 2* Inside talent hotbeds -> `moments of slow, fitful struggle`

To perform deep practice in climbing, one must pick routes in one's "sweet spot": hard enough to pose a challenge,
easy enough to have progress. Perhaps this synergizes with the climbing pyramid, by starting with filling up the base
and then practicing conquered routes again.

> *p. 13* ```The first time we watch Brunio try the move,
he fails, then stops and thinks. He does it again more slowly
and fails again—the ball squirts away. He stops and thinks
again. He does it even more slowly, breaking the move down
to its component parts—this, this, and that.```

Like "reading the route" upon failure. Rehearse the moves before trying again. This and that, this, this, and that.
If you make a mistake during a route, let go to avoid wasting endurance and think about what feels wrong then adjust.

> *p. 18* ```Deep practice is built on a paradox: struggling in certain
targeted ways—operating at the edges of your ability, where
you make mistakes—makes you smarter. Or to put it a slightly
different way, experiences where you're forced to slow down,
make errors, and correct them—as you would if you were
walking up an ice-covered hill, slipping and stumbling as you
go—end up making you swift and graceful without your real-
izing it.```

Deep practice is built upon failure. One should not be afraid of failure. Seek failure.
Tie this to Ego Is The Enemy. Why be afraid if it has objectively good properties, such as accelerated learning?

This is not to say one should join all contests. Say: a comp where routes are 5.12+ and one's climbing limit is 5.11.
There is nothing to be gained in that. I think one should seek out comps where the grades are within his limit ability,
so 5.11 comp would be ideal.

If one objectively assesses his abilities one can arrive at the correct conlusion.

> *p. 18* ```One real encounter, even for a
few seconds, is far more useful than several hundred observa-
tions.```

> *p. 20* Link Trainer

Learn by doing. Always by doing. E.g. if someone is teaching and you wanna learn, always volunteer for the hands-on part.

> *p. 27* Brazil's secret weapon -> ```One reason lies in the math. Futsal players touch the ball
far more often than soccer players—six times more often per
minute, according to a Liverpool University study. The smaller,
heavier ball demands and rewards more precise handling—as
coaches point out, you can't get out of a tight spot simply by
booting the ball downfield. Sharp passing is paramount: the
game is all about looking for angles and spaces and working
quick combinations with other players. Ball control and vi-
sion are crucial, so that when futsal players play the full-size
game, they feel as if they have acres of free space in which to
operate.```

How to replicate futsal for climbing? More climbing volume. 

More volume -> Volume is rooted in endurance/power endurance.

ARC-M: ARC training + movement drills
4x4SS: Doing bouldering 4x4's at the sweet spot
pre-reading routes to save energy + identify rests

## Chapter 2: The Deep Practice Cell

> *p. 32* ```The more we fire a particular circuit, the more
myelin optimizes that circuit, and the stronger, faster, and
more fluent our movements and thoughts become.```

Mistakes in climbing signify a weak circuit. It needs to be optimized through repetition.
Condition yourself to respond happily when you find low-grade routes you have difficulty in.
They are a myelin treasure chest!

LOW GRADE + FAILURE = REPETITION x HAPPINESS

> *p. 33* ```Skill is myelin insulation that wraps neural circuits and that grows according to certain signals.```

Skill as a muscle.

> *p. 34* ```Q: Why is targeted, mistake-focused practice so effec-
tive?
A: Because the best way to build a good circuit is to fire
it, attend to mistakes, then fire it again, over and over.
Struggle is not an option: it's a biological requirement.
Q: Why are passion and persistence key ingredients of
talent?
A: Because wrapping myelin around a big circuit re-
quires immense energy and time. If you don't love it,
you'll never work hard enough to be great.```

> *p. 52* ```In Genius Explained, Dr. Michael Howe of Exeter
University estimates that Mozart, by his sixth birthday, had
studied 3,500 hours of music with his instructor-father, a fact
that places his musical memory in the realm of impressive but
obtainable skill.```

Geniuses practiced. A lot. Obsessively.

## Chapter 3: The Brontes, the Z-Boys, and the Renaissance

The Brontes wrote so much shit when they were young. Wuthering heights was just a pro-written rehash of the author's crap old story. It's an awesome revision!

Z-boys were surfers who transitioned to skateboarding.

Maybe there's a way I can leverage my old myelin and add to climbing. 

Weightlifting (reps + set discipline, progressive overload)

Progressive overload: ability to estimate route difficulty limit and do laps of those. 

Martial arts (polishing combos until one can execute them flawlessly)

Aim for re-climbing completed routes perfectly.

Lesson: bring in your past shit! It might help.

Renaissance 

Because of guilds, they had lotta practice, lotta feedback pretty fast!

## Chapter 4: The Three Rules of Deep Practice

> ```To investigate, he set up an experiment involving both
master players and more ordinary ones. De Groot placed
chess pieces into positions from a real game, gave the players
a five-second glimpse of the board, and then tested their re-
call. The results were what one might expect. The master
players recalled the pieces and arrangements four to five times
better than the ordinary players did. (World-class players
neared 100 percent recall.)
Then de Groot did something clever. Instead of using pat-
terns from a real chess game, he set the chess pieces in a ran-
dom arrangement and reran the test. Suddenly the masters'
advantage vanished. They scored no better than lesser play-
ers; in one case, a master chess player did worse than a novice.
The master players didn't have photographic memories; when
the game stopped resembling chess, their skills evaporated.```

Recognizing patters. That's why always aim to climb the weirdest routes you can.

Analyze which route types you lack, holds, angles, etc.

> ```Chunking is a strange concept. The idea that skill—which
is graceful, fluid, and seemingly effortless—should be created
by the nested accumulation of small, discrete circuits seems
counterintuitive, to say the least.```

Try to break down how you climb into the smallest detail. Be verbose. It doesn't have to make sense to others.
Perhaps write down a particularly difficult beta on your phone while resting. Don't be tamad to THINK.

RULE ONE: CHUNK

**Absorb the whole thing**

> ```. People in the hotbeds stare and listen in this way quite a
lot. It sounds rather Zen, but it basically amounts to absorbing
a picture of the skill until you can imagine yourself doing it.
"We're prewired to imitate," Anders Ericsson says. "When
you put yourself in the same situation as an outstanding per-
son and attack a task that they took on, it has a big effect on
your skill."```

Create own hotbed by watching really good climbers on YouTube/Vimeo.

> ```At Spartak it's called imitatsiya—rallying in slow motion
with an imaginary ball. All Spartak's players do it, from the
five-year-olds to the pros.```

Exercise visualization/reading the route. Mandatory before climb always read route no matter how easy (!!!) 
I don't enforce this currently. I should.

**Break into chunks**

> ```Students scissor each measure of their sheet music into horizontal
strips, which are stuffed into envelopes and pulled out in ran-
dom order. They go on to break those strips into smaller frag-
ments by altering rhythms. For instance, they will play a
difficult passage in dotted rhythm (the horses' hooves
sound—da- dum, da-dum). This technique forces the player to
quickly link two of the notes in a series, then grants them a
beat of rest before the next two-note link. The goal is always
the same: to break a skill into its component pieces (circuits),
memorize those pieces individually, then link them together in
progressively larger groupings (new, interconnected circuits).```

Can apply to working a route. Work the route at the hardest part.

(!!!) Weird idea: Route-mixing: climb 2 routes, alternating colors between panels. Can perhaps try this on autobelay.

I tend to climb fast, perhaps when a route is easy enough for me to complete, I should practice climbing it slowly.

(!!!) Slow climbing high-grade routes I find easy. For a more general audience, if you find a high-grade route easy
try climbing it in the opposite style.

**Slow it down**

> ```going slow allows you to attend
more closely to errors, creating a higher degree of precision
with each firing```

Supports my slow climbing theory.

> ```This showed that experts practice differently and far
more strategically. When they fail, they don't blame it on luck
or themselves. They have a strategy they can fix.```

Never allow retries in climbing without verbal confirmation that something different will be tried.

RULE TWO: REPEAT

> ```As Vladimir Horowitz, the virtuoso
pianist who kept performing into his eighties, put it, "If I skip
practice for one day, I notice. If I skip practice for two days,
my wife notices. If I skip for three days, the world notices."```

Try to plan some form of practice per day. Sayang progress. Practice even if mabilis lang.

RULE THREE : LEARN TO FEEL IT

> ```The point, Skye explained, is to get a balance point where
you can sense the errors when they come. To avoid the mis-
takes, first you have to feel them immediately.```

Feel wrong moves right away. Let go and try something else if wrong.

> ```"Most kids accelerate their practice fairly quickly," said
Meadowmount director Owen Carman. "I think of it as a turn
inward; they stop looking outside for solutions and they reach
within. They come to terms with what works and what
doesn't. You can't fake it, you can't borrow, steal, or buy it.
It's an honest profession."```

Do what works for you
